# freeCodeCamp London Meetups FAQ

## Q. What is freeCodeCamp?
freeCodeCamp is a free online coding platform and global network of software and web development enthusiasts. It aims to make coding accessible to anyone; all you need is a computer, an Internet connection and a desire to learn.

## Q. I want to learn to code, where should I start?
Sign up for a free account on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and go for it! You'll need to learn to make use of a variety of resources in order to become a developer, but we think it really is the best starting point. Also, remember the curriculum is structured in recommended order, but you can use it any way you like and don't have to follow everything sequentially if you don't want to.

## Q. What is freeCodeCamp London?
freeCodeCamp London is one of many groups around the world who run regular meetups and facilitate online discussion through the [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/y8y4b577) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.london) groups, as well as the [official freeCodeCamp forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/united-kingdom-study-groups/london).

## Q. How do I find out about meetups?
Details of all our upcoming meetups can be found on the [official freeCodeCamp forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/united-kingdom-study-groups/london) and on our [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-London/).

For some it's enough to just click the 'attending' button, but depending on the venue you may need to register on a different website so please read the details carefully before turning up.

We usually announce meetups about a month in advance.

## Q. Who can come to meetups?
If you're under 18 then you must be accompanied by an adult, but apart from that everyone is welcome. And as for ability, it doesn't matter if you've never written a line of code before and you're just curious to learn how to get started, or if you've been working as a software developer for several decades.

## Q. Will I be the only newbie?
Almost certainly not! In general, probably about a third of people who attend are coming for the first time.

## Q. If I come along to try it out, am I committing to anything?
Not at all, unless you want to. It's perfectly fine to just come once or twice, and if it's not for you then nobody will make you feel bad for not coming back. But hopefully you will!

## Q. Where do meetups take place?
Check the details for each individual event, but generally we are hosted by [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) in Code Node, situated between Moorgate and Liverpool Street stations, or [Makers](https://makers.tech) in Spitalfields.

## Q. How often do meetups take place?
At least once a month, but we aim to do them every fortnight. It depends on venue availability, so sometimes there may be a slightly longer gap between sessions.

## Q. Do I have to pay?
Nope, the clue's in the name :) But please register beforehand; depending on the venue you may get turned away if you don't do so in advance, so read the event details carefully before turning up.

## Q. How long do they last?
Usually about two and a half hours, but there's no pressure to stay until the end. It's also fine to arrive late, though it's better to arrive on time or a few minutes early.

## Q. What happens at a meetup?
Our meetups are generally quite loose and unstructured, the idea being to create a relaxed, low-pressure environment for anyone to be able to come and enjoy themselves, particularly for people who aren't used to coming to tech meetups regularly.

However, at the beginning, we do usually split up into groups based on what people are most interested in, which are generally:
* People who want to work on specific coding challenges. These can be exercises, algorithms or projects from the freeCodeCamp curriculum, but anything goes really. For example, some people find it useful to work through a [CodeWars](http://codewars.com/) kata with another person. The focus is usually on JavaScript and other web technologies, but again it doesn't have to be limited to that.
* People who want to discuss their experiences in looking for a job as a developer and get some advice. This can be for those who are making a career switch into software development for the first time, or those who are looking to move from a junior to a mid or even senior position.
* Any other general discussion about coding, tech and life as a software developer! Many of our members see making friends and general networking as the main benefit of attending the meetups.

Don't feel that you have to stay in the same spot once you've chosen a group to start with, it's perfectly fine to move around the room throughout the session.

There is also always a short show and tell, to give anyone the opportunity to present something they've been working on to the group, or share something interesting that they've learned. Let us know on [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/y8y4b577) before the session if you're interested in taking part.

## Q. How many people usually attend?
It varies a lot, but generally around 20 to 30.

## Q. Do I need to bring anything?
It's a good idea to bring your laptop if you have one, but it isn't a requirement to join in.

## Q. Is food provided?
Assume that it won't be, but where food is available then it will be specified in the event details. There is always free tea, coffee and biscuits though.

## Q. I'd like to set up my own study group, how do I do this?
If you're looking for people at a similar level to meet with on a regular basis in order to work through the freeCodeCamp curriculum together, feel free to post on the [forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/united-kingdom-study-groups/london), [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/y8y4b577) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.london). Before you do, it's better if you already have a venue in mind that would be suitable for sitting down with laptops. Alternatively, it's quite likely that you'll find people in a similar situation to you at the general meetups, so it's always a good idea to come along to one of those first before posting straight to the wall.

## Q. Are any of the organisers at freeCodeCamp London paid?
Nope, everyone's a volunteer and they are not directly employed by freeCodeCamp. All views expressed are their own and not necessarily those of freeCodeCamp.

## Q. I have another question that isn't answered above, who can I ask?
Feel free to send me (Matt) a private message on [Slack](https://tinyurl.com/y8y4b577) or [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/freeCodeCamp-London/), or just post your question in the general discussion or in the discussion for a particular event.
